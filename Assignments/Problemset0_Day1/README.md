## Day 1 â†’ Functions & Variables

1. Problem statement : In a file calledÂ `indoor.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing aÂ `str`Â of your own as an argument toÂ `input`.
2. Problem statement : In a file calledÂ `playback.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space withÂ `...` (i.e., three periods).
3. Problem statement : In a file called faces.py , implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to ğŸ˜Š and any :( converted to ğŸ˜Ÿ
    
    All other text should be returned unchanged.
    
    Then, in that same file, implement a function calledÂ `main`Â that prompts the user for input, callsÂ `convert`Â on that input, and prints the result. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing aÂ `str`Â of your own as an argument toÂ `input`. Be sure to callÂ `main`Â at the bottom of your file.
    
4. Problem statement : In a file calledÂ `einstein.py` , implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer. 
Hint: E =mc^2
5.  In the United States, itâ€™s customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your mealâ€™s cost. Not to worry, though, weâ€™ve written a tip calculator for you, below!
    
    ```python
    **def** main():
        dollars = dollars_to_float(input("How much was the meal? "))
        percent = percent_to_float(input("What percentage would you like to tip? "))
        tip = dollars * percent
        print(f"Leave $**{**tip**:**.2f**}**")
    
    **def** dollars_to_float(d):
        *# TODO*
    **def** percent_to_float(p):
        *# TODO*
    main()
    ```
    
    Well, weâ€™ve writtenÂ *most*Â of a tip calculator for you. Unfortunately, we didnâ€™t have time to implement two functions:
    
    - `dollars_to_float`, which should accept aÂ `str`Â as input (formatted asÂ `$##.##`, wherein eachÂ `#`Â is a decimal digit), remove the leadingÂ `$`, and return the amount as aÂ `float`. For instance, givenÂ `$50.00`Â as input, it should returnÂ `50.0`.
    - `percent_to_float`, which should accept aÂ `str`Â as input (formatted asÂ `##%`, wherein eachÂ `#`Â is a decimal digit), remove the trailingÂ `%`, and return the percentage as aÂ `float`. For instance, givenÂ `15%`Â as input, it should returnÂ `0.15`.
    
    Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats.
